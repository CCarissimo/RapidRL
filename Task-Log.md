# Open Trails:

	- FRESH agent train method so that training of estimators is separate from action selection 


# Potential Trails:

	- FRESH agent or estimator function to calculate bias with respect to action-value function 


# Closed Trails:

	- ADJUST the learning plots so that there is a fixed maximum number of steps
	- ADJUST the learning plots so that the greedy evaluation starts from the initial state

# Notes:

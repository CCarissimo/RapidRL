##Introduction

This repository is used to store code worked on for a project with the CWI. The goal of this project is to explore techniques that can be used to speed up reinforcement learning, seeking for useful behavior above optimal behavior. We call this Rapid Reinforcement Learning. To this end we try a complementary combination of exploratory methods, and multi-level abstractions to improve performance in simulated games.
